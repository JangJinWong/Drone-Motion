 #### 1. Abstract:
- ######  The current methods of piloting drones are difficult and not easily accessible. The average person might have an interest in drones, but does not want to spend time going through the learning curve. This exposed a void which could be filled. We present a sensor-free, accurate, and intuitive system for hand motion controlled UAV piloting. Our method efficiently classifies hand gestures from simple video capture, translating them to drone motion. Our implementation takes advantage of the strength of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve high accuracies. In order to eliminate discrepancies due to different people and backgrounds during classification, a simple calibration technique is used to maintain reliability. Furthermore, a Discrete Bayes Filter is used to sequentially process frames and estimate the state of the system. We hope our model will serve as a platform for people to easily and intuitively fly drones.
