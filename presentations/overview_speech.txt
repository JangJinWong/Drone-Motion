Looking back, I remember as a kid I always dreamed about having super powers. 
Watching movies such as Harry Potter or Star Wars made me want to be a Wizard or a Jedi. 
I truly believed that one day I would do incredible things with the move of a hand.

Unfortunately, I never received an invitation to Hogwarts nor became one with the force. 
The closest alternative was controlling characters in video games. And in recent times, 
technologies such as the Wii U, Kinect, or VR have come close to satisfying our childhood dreams.

But ask yourself, why video games, why not real life? Kids, teenagers, adults and even 
seniors should all be able to experience the joy of using magic and feeling the force.
All at an affordable cost!

Drones are known for being difficult to fly. Though this has recently improved with 
self-flying software, we think we can make the experience more intuitive and eliminate 
the learning curve. We will build a system that recognizes and classifies hand gestures, 
and translates them to drone motion. Unlike other solutions that have used various sensors, 
our system uses (the force) only images captured through a camera. We plan to use deep learning 
methods to build our classifier.

In summary, although many of you were not admitted to Hogwarts, now you can experience 
something similar to casting a spell or using the force. Using a simple camera, you will 
be able to do incredible things with the move of a hand.

Thank you, questions?
